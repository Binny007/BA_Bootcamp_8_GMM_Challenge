# üéØ Gaussian Mixture Model ‚Äì Behavioral Segmentation Challenge

Welcome to the **Gaussian Mixture Model Challenge**, a hands-on project to explore the power of **unsupervised learning** through **Behavioral Segmentation**. In this challenge, you‚Äôll dive into real-world customer data, apply **probabilistic clustering**, and generate actionable customer segments.

---

## üß© Challenge Overview

Most companies build value-based segmentation ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt always reveal **who the customers truly are** or **how they behave**.

That‚Äôs where **Behavioral Segmentation** comes in. Your mission is to **uncover customer personas** using their actual transactional behavior.

## üöÄ Steps to Complete the Challenge

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare the Dataset

- Include all relevant dimensions for segmentation.
- Make sure all variables are in **numeric format** for the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to work.
- Handle any missing values and clean the data accordingly.

> ‚úÖ Dataset used: `CC GENERAL.csv`  
> üìÑ Variable descriptions: `CC GENERAL data dictionary.docx`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters

- Use **AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)** and **BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)** to evaluate the model.
- Lower values = better model fit.
- Plot AIC/BIC scores across a range of cluster numbers to decide the optimal count.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

- Use the `sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture` class.
- Fit the model to the dataset (excluding the `CustomerID` column).
- Predict customer clusters and assign them to the original dataset.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Interpret the Segments

- Analyze the **means of each cluster** to understand typical behavior.
- Assign meaningful names to each cluster.
- Get creative! Add labels that reflect customer lifestyles or spending behavior.

> üß† Example Segments:
> - Cluster 0: *Lower Middle Class*
> - Cluster 1: *Inactive*
> - Cluster 2: *High Rollers*
> - Cluster 3: *Conscious High Income*
> - Cluster 4: *Upper Middle Class*
> - Cluster 5: *Active Purchasers*
